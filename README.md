- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frext

Hello, my name is Furkan. I'm interested in computers since I was 8. I started coding with Scratch. Then, I learned C when I was 13. Later on, I learned C# and Python. Currently, I'm coding in C# and Kotlin. 
I'm learning Kotlin to be an Android developer. And I want to learn Tkinter for Desktop GUI.
